# Okta Actions

Introducing Okta Actions for Zendesk. An app based on the Zendesk app framework that allows IT admins to quickly execute Okta user tasks in Zendesk such as:

- Reset Passwords
- Unlock accounts
- Suspend accounts
- Deactivate accounts
- Delete existing sessions
- Reset Multifactor enrollments

To install, download the app zip from Github. Log into your Zendesk instance >> Settings >> Apps >> Manage >> Upload private app

The app is currently pending approval in Zendesk Marketplace, Iâ€™m hoping to have it approved soon but in the meantime you can always install it from its Github Source.

During installation, you will need to provide the following:

- Okta Subdomain (eg. xyz.okta.com; enter xyz)
- Okta API Key (https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/overview/)

Please note this is not an official Okta app.<br><br>
